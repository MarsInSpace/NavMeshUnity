# NavMeshUnity

This is a game developed in a Unity and C# programming course within the BA Game Design I am doing.  
The goal was to learn how to use the NavMesh components in the Unity Editor, as well as how to modify it during runtime.

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
